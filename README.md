Problem Statement
OLIST is a Brazilian e-commerce giant similar to Amazon. The company is looking to leverage the power of analytics to improve its processes and improve its product offering. You need to step into the shoes of the DS transformation in charge. The leadership team at OLIST has identified some projects that they think will create value in the business.  Now, there are certain constraints in the company; the company has set up the data science team recently. The team is small, and resources are limited. Given such a situation, you have to choose the right roadmap for DS adoption based on the size, feasibility, complexity and value of the use case. You are required to create a presentation that will demonstrate the road to DS adoption and the monetary benefits that will accompany the adoption. You may use the following points to create your presentation:
* Company objective
* Impact of the project on the company objective
* Feasibility check of the project 
* Data and skill requirements for the project
* DS solution approach (Refer to the module on Data Strategy)
* Changes in the current process on account of adopting the solution 
* Developing a proof of concept
* Suitable success metric 
* Estimated monetary benefits of the project
